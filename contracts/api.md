# Gaffer API contract

The HTTP and WebSocket contract between the Gaffer service and its clients (the web UI, the Mac shell).

## Service

Everything in this section is served by the Python service in `service/`. It listens on `127.0.0.1` only. Every route and `/ws` need the session cookie. Errors are `{"error": "<code>", "message": "<plain words>"}` and never carry a path.

### GET /api/models

Every model Gaffer knows, whatever the brand. Godox models come from lumen's table (`service/gaffer/data/models.json`). Every other model comes from a model file. In demo mode the list also holds demo-only stand-ins.

```json
{
  "models": [
    {
      "id": "003A", "radio_id": "003A", "name": "SL60IIBi",
      "kind": "bicolour", "kind_label": "Bi-colour",
      "driver": "godox", "brand": "Godox",
      "match": {"name_prefix": "PL1", "service": "0000fee9-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb"},
      "features": {"white": true, "daylight": false, "colour": false, "channels": false, "tint": false,
                   "gels": "white", "builtin_effects": 0, "fan": false, "battery": false,
                   "smoothness": false, "control_modes": false}
    }
  ],
  "skipped": [{"file": "zhiyun/BAD.json", "reason": "driver does not match the folder"}],
  "drivers": [{"id": "godox"}],
  "drivers_skipped": [{"driver": "somebrand", "reason": "could not be imported"}]
}
```

- `features` is `ModelCaps.features`. Its keys do not change; the Glass UI lays out its controls from it.
- `id` is the model id. `radio_id` is the same value, kept for older clients.
- `match` is `{}` for Godox table rows.
- `skipped` lists model files that could not be used, with a reason in plain words. `file` is `<driver>/<name>.json` and never an absolute path.
- The WebSocket `hello` message keeps its `models` list (id, name, kind, driver, brand) for the model picker. It leaves out demo stand-ins.

### Model files

One file per model: `service/gaffer/models/<driver>/<ID>.json`. The service also reads `<data folder>/models/<driver>/<ID>.json` (on a Mac, `~/Library/Application Support/Gaffer/models/`), so a model can be added with no code change. A file with the same `id` as a table row replaces that row. A later folder replaces an earlier one.

A model file is one row of lumen's `models.json` plus these keys:

| Key | Type | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | Required. 1 to 32 characters from `A-Z a-z 0-9 _ -`, starting with a letter or digit. Case-insensitive. Must equal the file name without `.json`. `constructor`, `prototype` and similar names are refused. |
| `driver` | string | Required. Must equal the folder name, and name a folder under `service/gaffer/drivers/`. |
| `brand` | string | Required. 1 to 64 characters. Shown to people. |
| `name` | string | Required. 1 to 120 characters. |
| `min_kelvin`, `max_kelvin` | integer | Required. 0 to 100000, `min_kelvin` not above `max_kelvin`. |
| `modes` | list of strings | `cct`, `hsi`, `rgb`, `color_chip`, `effects` and so on. Default empty. |
| `match` | object | Optional. `name_prefix` (string up to 64 characters) and `service` (a Bluetooth UUID, 16, 32 or 128 bit). No other keys. |
| `driver_data` | object | Optional. Whatever the driver needs for this model. Opaque to everything else. |

Every other lumen row key (`effects`, `fan_modes`, `rgb_channels`, `battery`, `gm_min`, `gm_max` and so on) is optional and read as in `models.json`.

A file that breaks a rule, cannot be read, is not a plain file, or is over 1 MiB is skipped with a reason. The rest still load. An unreadable file never replaces the row it was meant to override. These size limits are Gaffer's own; no platform sets them.

### Drivers

A driver is a folder under `service/gaffer/drivers/<name>/` that defines a concrete subclass of `gaffer.drivers.base.Driver`. The registry (`gaffer.drivers.build_drivers`) imports every folder and registers its drivers. A folder that fails to import is skipped and reported in `drivers_skipped`.

The contract is in `service/gaffer/drivers/base.py`: `id`, `match(advert)`, `start()`, `stop()`, `connect(light)`, `apply(light, LightState)`, `identify(light)`, `status(light)` returning `{reachable, held}`, and pure `encode_*` functions beside the driver. `apply` is synchronous, never blocks, and the latest state wins.

A light uses the driver its model's `driver` key names. If that driver is not installed, the light shows as unreachable and takes no commands.

### Light fields

The light objects in `hello`, `lights` and `/api/export` gain:

- `channel`: integer or null. The radio channel a light is set to, for brands that need one told to them (Yongnuo). Saved with the light.
- `caps.driver`, `caps.brand`, `caps.match`, `caps.driver_data`.
